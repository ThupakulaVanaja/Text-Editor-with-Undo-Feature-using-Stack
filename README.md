# Text-Editor-with-Undo-Feature-using-Stack
A simple C-based text editor with undo and redo functionality using stacks. It supports text insertion, deletion, and efficient undo/redo operations. Changes are tracked using two stacks to store the history of text states. This project demonstrates basic text manipulation and stack-based state management.
